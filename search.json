    "text": "Quarto Example\n\n\nI’m creating a new blog, and was surveying the various options. I’ve been using the default Jekyll “Pages” functionality offered from Github for years, but it’s time to move to something more modern.\nI came across Quarto from a recent post by Jeremy Howard, and was immediately sold. Quarto has its lineage somewhat in the realm of Tex, which is an ancient text setting program written by Donald Knuth, one of the early fathers of computer programming. The Tex computer program eventually evolved into LaTex, which has a scholarly citation management system called BibTeX. Quarto has a mechanism to use these scholarly bibliographic formats, like the ones I maintain for myself when I was writing my dissertation.\nHowever, instead of using the somewhat obtuse LaTex syntax, Quarto uses variations on Markdown, which is a much simpler plain text format for creating basic formatted text. The “qmd” format is easy enough to type out manually with no editor other than a basic terminal (which is also what I use to write these posts). You can see the basic qmd format for this post here.\nI find that I don’t need to write as many mathematical formulas here. Although Quarto enables that easily as well. Here’s one of my favorites, the formula for entropy in information theory.\n\\[H(X) = -\\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i) \\log p(x_i)\\]\nI can also draw some simple diagrams using a builtin Mermaid syntax:\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Hard edge] --&gt; B(Round edge)\n  B --&gt; C{Decision}\n  C --&gt; D[Result one]\n  C --&gt; E[Result two]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can also easily embed youtube clips:\n\nAll in all, most of the basic WYSIWYG formatting work is handled through simple text specification. There’s ways to tweak things even more using css, but for now I’m happy with some basic defaults and theming.\nThere’s two main reasons why I think it’s worth using Quarto:\n\nIt’s Free\nIt doesn’t cost a dime to use Quarto. I simply took the time to set it up with my free Github account, and use it to publish my site free on Github as well.\nNow, there are some that will argue that Quarto is not at all free, in fact it costs time to set this up and write things yourself.\nHowever, I would also argue:\n\n\nIt Has a High “Give a S@&$! Factor”\nWe’re entering an age where most text written online will be generated or influenced by a generative AI. This post has been written with the help of one. However, I believe that human communication requires some actual proof of work… some way of showing that the author cares about the topic. It’s going to get very difficult to do that unless you structure your communication in a way that shows a deep level of interest in a topic, and not just churning out one-off dross for the sake of posting to Linkedin.\nThe main reason isn’t that it’s cheap or shows you care though, it’s because you should own your story as long as you can, and you will probably outlive any company that tries to do too many things for you. This brings up the next advantage of Quarto:\n\n\nIt’s Open Source and Lindy\nTechnology has been around long enough that it should be clear that languages, frameworks, and applications come and go along with the companies that invent them. The concept of the Lindy effect argues that future life expectancy of some non-perishable thing (like an idea or technology) is proportional to its age. Right now, Quarto is built on top of some of the oldest ideas in all of computer theory, and it’s editable and usable inside my Neovim editor, which itself is based off of the VI editor from 1976, using the QWERTY keyboard layout from 1878.\nNone of these technologies are going to go anywhere. They’re good bets for writing things down that you want to control and preserve.\n\n\nThanks for Reading!\nI hope I gave a good overview of what Quarto is about, and why it matters. Thanks for taking the time to read. Hoping to see your Quarto site out there some day!\n\n\n\n\n© Copyright 2024 Justin Donaldson. Except where otherwise noted, all rights reserved.

They had some of the same notions I had on the importance of Directed Acyclic Graphs as a fundamental programming theme. Their decorator-based approach for static methods creates the necessary coupling between imperative graph steps, and overall graph execution order in an especially elegant way. I believe most people will adopt it at some point if they are using Python to manage data. It’s just that good! You can try Dagworks Hamilton framework online, or check it out on Github. You can also follow their blog.\n\n\n\nDagworks DAG Example"

There’s an awful lot you can learn about someone in a 30 minute drive to the airport, and I got a chance to hear about Litepulse (soon to be PulseSpace), and their goal of providing remote power for satellites. With the growth of the private space industry thanks to SpaceX and Blue Origin, there’s a whole ecosystem of young startups looking to provide service level agreements for orbital infrastructure. PulseSpace is looking to be a sort of “gas station” for satellites that may have malfunctioning or damaged solar panels, or maybe they just need some extra juice. Even though I don’t have a background in astrophysics, I think they’re bound to run into all sorts of gnarly software problems. I’m happy to help however I can there, and I also learned the driving for Lyft in a targeted fashion is a great way to hustle up a few connections.\n\n\n\nLitePulse Image"
