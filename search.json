The paths of hurricanes, the spread of wildfires, the beating of the human heart—all of these chaotic systems play out in a space far smaller than their theoretical possibilities.\nOne way of better understanding fractal dimensionality is to understand that it’s not a dimension at all, it’s way of understanding how dimensions change through scaling.\nA good way of understanding this phenomenon is to try and measure a coastline.\nAs one shrinks the resolution of their measurement of a coastline, the length one measures will change, but the amount of change is typically bounded within a given range.\n© Copyright 2024 Justin Donaldson.

    "section": "Neural Network Fractals",
    "text": "Neural Network Fractals\nNeural networks, especially deep learning architectures, actually exhibit fractal-like properties in their information processing and representational spaces. Just as fractals demonstrate non-integer dimensionality by creating complex structures through recursive self-similarity, neural networks generate intricate representations by layering increasingly abstract and self-similar feature transformations.\nConsider convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as an example. As information passes through successive layers, the network progressively extracts features at different scales and levels of abstraction - much like how a fractal reveals different geometric patterns when you zoom in or out. Each layer can be thought of as a kind of “scaling” operation where local patterns are transformed into more global, complex representations. It is a sort of map of the chaos that exists at different levels of abstraction. And, it’s clear that the model is learning some of the same patterns at different levels of abstraction.\n\n\n\nNeural Feature Hierarchy\n\n\nThe fractal-like behavior emerges most clearly in how neural networks handle high-dimensional data. When processing complex inputs like images or language, networks don’t simply map inputs to outputs linearly. Instead, they create multi-dimensional, non-linear transformation spaces where local similarities and global structures coexist - precisely the kind of space where fractal mathematics becomes compelling.\nResearchers like Geoffrey Hinton have even suggested that neural network “feature spaces” might be better understood through fractal geometry than traditional Euclidean approaches. The networks generate representations that are neither purely low-dimensional nor simply high-dimensional, but exist in a kind of fractal in-between state. He gives some of his most recent insight on it here\nMore concretely, techniques like fractal interpolation and fractal compression have direct computational analogues in how neural networks learn and generalize. Both involve recursive strategies for capturing complex patterns at multiple scales of resolution. This holds for images and text in several senses. Transformer models can “hallucinate” parts of an image at any scale, and language models can condense or expand text handily through summary or extrapolation."

    "section": "The Fractal Shortcut to Understanding",
    "text": "The Fractal Shortcut to Understanding\nArtificial Intelligence is often accused of being “brute force,” of needing endless data to approximate human intuition. But intelligence—biological or artificial—works because the world isn’t as high-dimensional as it seems. The constraints of physics, economics, and even human behavior force events to unfold along surprisingly low-dimensional manifolds. Chaos, for all its turbulence, is confined to a fractal space. While there may be “No Free Lunch” from a pure statistical point of view, we thankfully live in a statistical world that happens to also be chaotic.\nThis is why deep learning models, trained on quintessentially chaotic market systems, can predict stock trends better than random guessing. It’s why language models, given enough text, can anticipate our next words with uncanny accuracy. They aren’t solving the problem in full dimensionality—they’re following the fractal contours where reality actually unfolds."

    "section": "AI as the Ultimate Chaos Hunter",
    "text": "AI as the Ultimate Chaos Hunter\nIf intelligence is about making sense of complexity, then AI is the ultimate tool for chasing Chaos. Traditional physics tries to model the world with explicit equations, but AI sidesteps that limitation. It doesn’t need the equations or full rules of a system—it learns the shape of Chaos directly from observation. Neural networks extract the latent structure from raw events, distilling their fractal dimensionality into something even smaller: a compressed model of reality that understands the large and the small, and how they can relate.\nThis is why AI-driven weather prediction is overtaking classical models. Why AI in finance can detect patterns even seasoned traders miss. And why AI in science is accelerating discoveries faster than human intuition alone ever could.\nIntelligence—ours or artificial—isn’t ultimately about defeating Chaos. It’s about finding its shape in the areas we care about, and learning how to ride its back when necessary. Part of my goal this year is to integrate more fractal consideration of data in my projects this year…. Oh and also to remember to hold on with both hands.\n\n\n\nRiding a Bull"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Quarto Example\n\n\nI’m creating a new blog, and was surveying the various options. I’ve been using the default Jekyll “Pages” functionality offered from Github for years, but it’s time to move to something more modern.\nI came across Quarto from a recent post by Jeremy Howard, and was immediately sold. Quarto has its lineage somewhat in the realm of Tex, which is an ancient text setting program written by Donald Knuth, one of the early fathers of computer programming. The Tex computer program eventually evolved into LaTex, which has a scholarly citation management system called BibTeX. Quarto has a mechanism to use these scholarly bibliographic formats, like the ones I maintain for myself when I was writing my dissertation.\nHowever, instead of using the somewhat obtuse LaTex syntax, Quarto uses variations on Markdown, which is a much simpler plain text format for creating basic formatted text. The “qmd” format is easy enough to type out manually with no editor other than a basic terminal (which is also what I use to write these posts). You can see the basic qmd format for this post here.\nI find that I don’t need to write as many mathematical formulas here. Although Quarto enables that easily as well. Here’s one of my favorites, the formula for entropy in information theory.\n\\[H(X) = -\\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i) \\log p(x_i)\\]\nI can also draw some simple diagrams using a builtin Mermaid syntax:\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Hard edge] --&gt; B(Round edge)\n  B --&gt; C{Decision}\n  C --&gt; D[Result one]\n  C --&gt; E[Result two]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can also easily embed youtube clips:\n\nAll in all, most of the basic WYSIWYG formatting work is handled through simple text specification. There’s ways to tweak things even more using css, but for now I’m happy with some basic defaults and theming.\nThere’s two main reasons why I think it’s worth using Quarto:\n\nIt’s Free\nIt doesn’t cost a dime to use Quarto. I simply took the time to set it up with my free Github account, and use it to publish my site free on Github as well.\nNow, there are some that will argue that Quarto is not at all free, in fact it costs time to set this up and write things yourself.\nHowever, I would also argue:\n\n\nIt Has a High “Give a S@&$! Factor”\nWe’re entering an age where most text written online will be generated or influenced by a generative AI. This post has been written with the help of one. However, I believe that human communication requires some actual proof of work… some way of showing that the author cares about the topic. It’s going to get very difficult to do that unless you structure your communication in a way that shows a deep level of interest in a topic, and not just churning out one-off dross for the sake of posting to Linkedin.\nThe main reason isn’t that it’s cheap or shows you care though, it’s because you should own your story as long as you can, and you will probably outlive any company that tries to do too many things for you. This brings up the next advantage of Quarto:\n\n\nIt’s Open Source and Lindy\nTechnology has been around long enough that it should be clear that languages, frameworks, and applications come and go along with the companies that invent them. The concept of the Lindy effect argues that future life expectancy of some non-perishable thing (like an idea or technology) is proportional to its age. Right now, Quarto is built on top of some of the oldest ideas in all of computer theory, and it’s editable and usable inside my Neovim editor, which itself is based off of the VI editor from 1976, using the QWERTY keyboard layout from 1878.\nNone of these technologies are going to go anywhere. They’re good bets for writing things down that you want to control and preserve.\n\n\nThanks for Reading!\nI hope I gave a good overview of what Quarto is about, and why it matters. Thanks for taking the time to read. Hoping to see your Quarto site out there some day!\n\n\n\n\n© Copyright 2024 Justin Donaldson. Except where otherwise noted, all rights reserved.

    "title": "Automated Coding with LLMs: Making a Rumpus",
    "section": "",
    "text": "TODO\n\n\nThis post introduces a simple tool, called rumpus that helps me keep track of TODOs, etc. using the macos menubar. It’s not that interesting on its own. What’s interesting is the fact that it’s written completely using a local LLM in 15 minutes. I wanted to write a quick post on the how and why of it, and how I see programming beginning to change with the increasing power that “off the shelf” LLM models can provide.\nAs a programmer, there are always minor improvements or tweaks I wish I could implement. However, the cost/benefit tradeoff often deters me from spending time on these enhancements. Recently, I’ve been exploring how to integrate large language models (LLMs) into my workflow to streamline this process.\nI prefer keeping reminders in the menubar at the top of my screen for easy access, but I find the flexibility of conventional “Todo” apps lacking. To address this, I started using TODO, FIXME, and other comments throughout my code, often accompanied by emojis. These comments are typically actionable and convey more information than a simple tag or word. My menubar is already pretty crowded enough!\nHere’s a sample piece of code with such comments:\n# TODO: Implement the function to calculate the factorial of a number\ndef factorial(n):\n    # XXX: This is a placeholder implementation\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        # FIXME: This recursive call might cause a stack overflow for large n\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n# TODO: Add proper error handling for invalid input\ndef safe_factorial(n):\n    try:\n        if n &lt; 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Negative numbers are not allowed\")\n        return factorial(n)\n    except TypeError:\n        print(\"Input must be an integer\")\n    except ValueError as ve:\n        print(ve)\n\n# NOTE: This is a test function to demonstrate the usage of factorial functions\ndef test_factorial():\n    test_cases = [0, 1, 5, -3, 'a']\n    for case in test_cases:\n        print(f\"Factorial of {case}: {safe_factorial(case)}\")\n\n# FIXME: Ensure that the main guard is correctly implemented\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_factorial()\nThese comments help track necessary actions across a project. While most IDEs display TODOs in a separate panel, my TODOs are scattered across multiple files, including markdown files that don’t require an editor. For instance, here’s a basic TODO panel from Eclipse. It’s nice, but Eclipse is a memory hog. I don’t want to open it just to see my list.\n\n\n\nExample IDE showing TODOS\n\n\nI wanted a centralized list of these flags visible in the menubar, which is always accessible regardless of the active program.\nThe rump library simplifies menubar configuration, but it requires reading the API documentation and managing basic UI functionality (e.g., showing file matches under the emoji and opening them when clicked). I started with a simple “Hello World” example using rumps, with the help of an LLM:\nimport rumps\n\nclass HelloWorldApp(rumps.App):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(HelloWorldApp, self).__init__(\"Hello World\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    HelloWorldApp().run()\nFrom there, it only took a few iterations to develop a script that processes path/extension arguments, searches through files, and tabulates the hits into emoji-based entries in the menubar. The final result looks like this:\n\n\n\nrumpus\n\n\nThis tally of tasks and reminders in my menubar was satisfying to create end-to-end using a library I wanted to work with and an LLM to help compose the functionality. Coding the entire thing took about 15 minutes, far less time than writing this blog post.\nAutomated coding is reaching a point where it can significantly shift the cost/benefit analysis for certain tasks. While there may still be challenges, I believe the resulting script is of higher quality than my usual “15 minute” hacks. I also learned that it’s a good idea to use a combination of libraries and tools as a starting point, rather than just letting the model decide itself what to use.\nThere’s certainly more to be written here, but it’s not bad for 15 minutes of coding!\n\n\n\n© Copyright 2024 Justin Donaldson.
