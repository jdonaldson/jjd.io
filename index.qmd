Hello! I'm Justin Donaldson, a passionate Human-Computer-Interaction/Data/AI
Scientist and Engineer with a diverse skill set spanning large language model
research, data science, and machine learning. My journey has led me from
academia to industry, and back again.  I'm always eager to learn something
complex, and turn it into something beautiful.

## What I know

My expertise encompasses model optimization, time series analysis, anomaly
detection, and advanced ML/web visualization. I'm well-versed in programming
languages like Python, R, and fluent with Docker and core web technologies.
Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse and impactful
projects with trusted Salesforce partners, crafting custom solutions ranging
from advanced customer behavior modeling for banks to anomaly detection models
for global enterprises.  Make sure to check out my [C.V.](cv.qmd) for more
details.

My academic research focused on improving user interaction design and
enhancing music recommendation systems through data visualization, social behavior analysis,
and acoustic features. Notable studies include creating hybrid recommendation
systems combining social and musical data, visualizing social network links for
better exploratory search, and exploring aesthetic interaction design. My work
also involves emotional experience design and the use of visualizations for
music discovery. For further details, visit the [publications section](https://jjd.io/cv.html#publications)

My patents span multiple areas in technology. They include
systems for real-time media consumption visualization, decision tree
interaction, and machine learning-based software testing. Other patents focus
on improving large dataset task performance, secure predictive modeling,
personal music recommendation systems, and error assignment in programming.
Additionally, my work includes addressing biases in document retrieval and
optimizing search rankings through machine learning techniques. These patents
collectively aim to improve user interaction, software performance, and data
analysis.  Visit the [patents section](https://jjd.io/cv.html#patents) for more details.

I have made notable contributions to education and open-source development. As
a co-instructor for UW 410 Advanced Machine Learning, I helped teach advanced
machine learning concepts at the [University of
Washington](https://www.pce.uw.edu/). I also served on the UW Advisory Board
for the School of Professional and Continuing Education. In the open-source
space, I developed a Lua target for the [Haxe language](https://haxe.org),
which wound up enabling video games such as Pokemon Sword & Shield to run
efficiently on the Nintendo Switch. Additionally, I mentored graduate students
in data science through [UCLA](https://grad.ucla.edu/)â€™s program and co-hosted
a data science competition with [Boston Day Academy](https://www.bdea.org/).

# Hushh.ai (CTO)

![Hushh.ai Seattle Team](images/hushh_ai.jpeg)

I'm helping start [Hushh.ai](http://www.hush.ai), a company I co-founded with
[Manish Sainani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manishsainani/) in 2024. At Hushh,
we're pioneering on-device hybrid LLM search capabilities and nurturing a
vibrant R&D culture with a talented team of international interns. You can read
more about what we're up to over at [Hushh Labs](https://hushh-labs.github.io/hushh-labs-blog/)


# Investor/Advisor

Since leaving Salesforce I invest and advise startups through the year.  Here's
a few folks and organizations I believe you should be keeping your eye on.

## Dagworks
![Stefan and I](images/stefan.jpeg)

I met [Stefan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skrawczyk/) and
[Elijah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elijahbenizzy/) when they were just
getting started building [Dagworks.io](https://www.dagworks.io/).  They had
some of the same notions I had on the importance of [Directed Acyclic
Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) as a fundamental
programming theme.  Their decorator-based approach for static methods creates
the necessary coupling between imperative graph steps, and overall graph
execution order in an especially elegant way.  I believe most people will adopt
it at some point if they are using Python to manage data.  It's just that good!
You can try [Dagworks Hamilton framework online](https://www.tryhamilton.dev/),
or check it out [on Github](https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton).  You can
also follow [their blog](https://blog.dagworks.io/).

## PulseSpace
![Karl and I](images/karl.jpeg)

I met [Karl Stedman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thekarlstedman/) and got a
chance to hear about [PulseSpace](https://pulsespace.com/).  PulseSpace's goal
is all about providing remote power for satellites.  With the growth of the
private space industry thanks to SpaceX and Blue Origin, there's a whole
ecosystem of young startups looking to provide service level agreements for
orbital infrastructure.  PulseSpace is looking to be a sort of "gas station"
for satellites that may have malfunctioning or damaged solar panels.  Even
though I don't have a background in astrophysics, I think they're bound to run
into all sorts of gnarly software problems that don't fit easily into
conventional industry applications.

# Previously

## Salesforce

![The Grenoble Team and I](images/grenoble.jpeg)

Prior to Hushh.ai, I spent a rewarding decade at Salesforce, where I wore
multiple hats as a Principal Data Scientist and Engineer. I had the privilege
to lead early search infrastructure modernization projects like migrating the
core search infrastructure to model-trained ranking coefficients, and also
developed patented deep learning models for detecting error states in
Salesforce's enormous code base. Under [Scott
Rickard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottrickard/) I co-founded the
Search/Service Cloud Datascience team and contributed significantly to the
creation of an ML education program for engineers. My contributions also
extended to investigating and developing GPT-3 technologies.


## BigML

![BigML Visualization](images/bigml.jpeg)

Earlier in my career, I co-founded BigML and served as its President from 2011
to 2013. There, I spearheaded the development of interactive model and
distribution visualizations and took charge of various administrative tasks,
setting the foundation for the company's growth.
