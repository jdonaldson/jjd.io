# About Me

Hello! I'm Justin Donaldson, a passionate Human-Computer-Interaction/Data/AI
Scientist and Engineer with a diverse skill set spanning large language model
research, data science, and machine learning. My journey has led me from
academia to industry, and back again.  I'm always eager to learn something
complex, and turn it into something beautiful.


# Currently

## CTO : Hushh

I'm helping start [Hushh.ai](http://www.hush.ai), a company I co-founded with
[Manish Sainani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manishsainani/) in 2024. At Hushh,
we're pioneering on-device hybrid LLM search capabilities and nurturing a
vibrant R&D culture with a talented team of international interns.

## Dagworks

I met [Stefan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skrawczyk/) and
[Elijah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elijahbenizzy/) when they were just
getting started building [Dagworks.io](https://www.dagworks.io/).  They had
some of the same notions I had on the importance of [Directed Acyclic
Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) as a fundamental
programming theme.  Their decorator-based approach for static methods creates
the necessary coupling between imperative graph steps, and overall graph
execution order in an especially elegant way.  I believe most people will adopt
it at some point if they are using Python to manage data.  It's just that good.

## PulseSpace

If you want to give your company the best chance for success, you have to think
outside the box in order to network.  I met [Karl
Stedman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thekarlstedman/) when he was taking me to
the airport as a Lyft driver.  There's an awful lot you can learn about someone
in a 30 minute drive to the airport, and I got a chance to hear about
[Litepulse](https://www.litepulse.com/) (soon to be
[PulseSpace](https://pulsespace.com/)), and their goal of providing remote
power for satellites.  With the growth of the private space industry thanks to
SpaceX and Blue Origin, there's a whole ecosystem of young startups looking to
provide service level agreements for orbital infrastructure.  PulseSpace is
looking to be a sort of "gas station" for satellites that may have
malfunctioning or damaged solar panels, or maybe they just need some extra
juice.  Even though I don't have a background in astrophysics, I think they're
bound to run into all sorts of gnarly software problems.  I'm happy to help
however I can there.

# Lately
Prior to Hushh.ai, I spent a rewarding decade at Salesforce, where I

wore multiple hats as a Principal Data Scientist and Engineer. I had the
privilege to lead early search infrastructure modernization projects like
migrating the core search infrastructure to model-trained ranking coefficients
, and also developed patented deep learning models for detecting error states
in Salesforce's enormous code base. I co-founded the Service Cloud Datascience
team and contributed significantly to the creation of an ML education program
for engineers. My contributions also extended to investigating and developing
GPT-3 technologies.

Earlier in my career, I co-founded BigML and served as its President from
2011 to 2013. There, I spearheaded the development of interactive
visualizations and took charge of various administrative tasks, setting the
foundation for the company's growth.

## What I know

My expertise encompasses model optimization, time series analysis, anomaly
detection, and advanced ML/web visualization. I'm well-versed in programming
languages like Python, R, and familiar with Docker and core web technologies.
Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse and impactful
projects with trusted Salesforce partners, crafting custom solutions ranging
from advanced candidate profilers to anomaly detection models for global
enterprises.  Make sure to check out my [C.V.](cv.qmd) for more details.
