:::{#hero-heading}

Hello! I'm Justin Donaldson, a passionate Human-Computer-Interaction/Data/AI
Scientist and Engineer with a diverse skill set spanning large language model
research, data science, and machine learning. My journey has led me from
academia to industry, and back again.  I'm always eager to learn something
complex, and turn it into something beautiful.

## What I know

My expertise encompasses model optimization, time series analysis, anomaly
detection, and advanced ML/web visualization. I'm well-versed in programming
languages like Python, R, and fluent with Docker and core web technologies.
Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse and impactful
projects with trusted Salesforce partners, crafting custom solutions ranging
from advanced customer behavior modeling for banks to anomaly detection models
for global enterprises.  Make sure to check out my [C.V.](cv.qmd) for more
details.

# Hushh.ai (CTO)

![Hushh.ai Seattle Team](images/hushh_ai.jpeg)

I'm helping start [Hushh.ai](http://www.hush.ai), a company I co-founded with
[Manish Sainani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manishsainani/) in 2024. At Hushh,
we're pioneering on-device hybrid LLM search capabilities and nurturing a
vibrant R&D culture with a talented team of international interns. You can read
more about what we're up to over at [Hushh Labs](https://hushh-labs.github.io/hushh-labs-blog/)



# Dagworks (Investor/Advisor)
![Stefan and I](images/stefan.jpeg)

I met [Stefan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skrawczyk/) and
[Elijah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elijahbenizzy/) when they were just
getting started building [Dagworks.io](https://www.dagworks.io/).  They had
some of the same notions I had on the importance of [Directed Acyclic
Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) as a fundamental
programming theme.  Their decorator-based approach for static methods creates
the necessary coupling between imperative graph steps, and overall graph
execution order in an especially elegant way.  I believe most people will adopt
it at some point if they are using Python to manage data.  It's just that good!
You can try [Dagworks Hamilton framework online](https://www.tryhamilton.dev/), or check it out [on Github](https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton)

# PulseSpace (Investor/Advisor)
![Karl and I](images/karl.jpeg)

I met [Karl Stedman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thekarlstedman/) when he was
taking me to the airport as a Lyft driver.  There's an awful lot you can learn
about someone in a 30 minute drive to the airport, and I got a chance to hear
about [Litepulse](https://www.litepulse.com/) (soon to be
[PulseSpace](https://pulsespace.com/)), and their goal of providing remote
power for satellites.  With the growth of the private space industry thanks to
SpaceX and Blue Origin, there's a whole ecosystem of young startups looking to
provide service level agreements for orbital infrastructure.  PulseSpace is
looking to be a sort of "gas station" for satellites that may have
malfunctioning or damaged solar panels, or maybe they just need some extra
juice.  Even though I don't have a background in astrophysics, I think they're
bound to run into all sorts of gnarly software problems.  I'm happy to help
however I can there, and I also learned the driving for Lyft in a targeted
fashion is a great way to hustle up a few connections.

# Previously

## Salesforce

![The Grenoble Team and I](images/grenoble.jpeg)

Prior to Hushh.ai, I spent a rewarding decade at Salesforce, where I wore
multiple hats as a Principal Data Scientist and Engineer. I had the privilege
to lead early search infrastructure modernization projects like migrating the
core search infrastructure to model-trained ranking coefficients, and also
developed patented deep learning models for detecting error states in
Salesforce's enormous code base. Under [Scott
Rickard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottrickard/) I co-founded the
Search/Service Cloud Datascience team and contributed significantly to the
creation of an ML education program for engineers. My contributions also
extended to investigating and developing GPT-3 technologies.




## BigML

![BigML Visualization](images/bigml.jpeg)

Earlier in my career, I co-founded BigML and served as its President from 2011
to 2013. There, I spearheaded the development of interactive model and
distribution visualizations and took charge of various administrative tasks,
setting the foundation for the company's growth.
