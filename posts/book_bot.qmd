# When AI Meets Family Legacy: A New Way to Interface with Investment Literature

In an era where ChatGPT makes headlines and generative AI seems to be everywhere, traditional books might appear antiquated. Yet, there's something powerful about the permanence of printed wisdom—especially when it captures pivotal moments in financial history and personal revelation. I recently had the unique opportunity to create an AI interface for my father's book, "The Hidden Power of Rising Dividends," and the experience revealed something fascinating about the intersection of traditional publishing and modern technology.

## The Story Behind the Book

The narrative begins on Black Monday—October 19, 1987. As markets worldwide spiraled downward, my father, Greg Donaldson, watched his clients' portfolios hemorrhage value. What could have been a career-ending catastrophe instead became a moment of profound insight, triggered by three unexpected phone calls that would reshape his entire approach to investment valuation.

The resulting book isn't just another investment manual. It's a deeply personal journey that weaves together market wisdom, faith, and the raw challenges of building a trustworthy financial practice during times of extreme market volatility. For those interested in the full story, you can find the book [here](https://www.gregdonaldson.com/).

## Bridging Generations Through Technology

Using the [hal9](https://hal9.com/) framework, we've created something unique: an AI agent that has thoroughly studied my father's investment philosophy and can engage in detailed discussions about the book's concepts. This isn't just another large language model trained on internet data—it's a specialized interface to a specific body of knowledge, maintaining the integrity of the original work while making it interactively accessible.

## Why This Matters

In our fast-paced digital age, we often sacrifice depth for breadth. While general-purpose AI models can speak broadly about many topics, there's immense value in systems that deeply understand specific, well-vetted sources. This approach creates a more reliable foundation for learning and discussion, especially in fields like investment where accuracy and context are crucial.

## Try It Yourself

Below this paragraph, you'll find an interactive interface where you can ask
questions about the book's concepts and investment philosophies for rising
income. While this AI agent can provide detailed information about the book's
content and concepts, please note that it cannot and should not provide
personalized financial advice. All interactions should be considered
educational in nature and not as recommendations for specific investment
decisions.

## Looking Forward

This project represents more than just a technological experiment—it's a bridge between traditional investment wisdom and modern accessibility. While the underlying technology (running on hardware comparable to a PS5 Pro) is impressive, what truly matters is how it helps preserve and transmit valuable knowledge across generations.

The future of financial education might just lie in this blend of time-tested wisdom and cutting-edge technology. By creating focused AI interfaces for specific, high-quality sources, we can maintain the depth and nuance of traditional literature while making it more accessible and interactive for modern learners.
