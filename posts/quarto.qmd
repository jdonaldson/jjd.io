![Blogging with Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/images/quarto-pub-admin-site.png)

I'm creating a new blog, and was surveying the various options. I've been using
the default Jekyll "Pages" functionality offered from Github for years, but it's time
to move to something more modern.

I came across [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) from a recent [post by Jeremy
Howard](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2022-07-28-nbdev2.html), and was immediately
sold.  Quarto has its lineage somewhat in the realm of Tex, which is an ancient
text setting program written by [Donald
Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth#Digital_typesetting), one of
the early fathers of computer programming.  The Tex computer program eventually
evolved into [LaTex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), which has a
scholarly citation management system called
[BibTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX). So, Quarto has a mechanism to
use scholarly bibliographic formats, like the ones I maintain [for
myself](https://github.com/jdonaldson/jjd.io/tree/main/bibliographies) when I
was writing my
[dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/openview/a8602e3dae373559fa6d87841fa265e6/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750).


However, instead of using the [somewhat
obtuse](http://xahlee.info/cmaci/notation/TeX_pestilence.html) LaTex syntax,
Quarto uses variations on [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown),
which is a much simpler plain text format for creating basic formatted
text.  The "qmd" format is easy enough to type out manually with no editor
other than a basic terminal (which is also what I use to write these posts).
You can see the basic qmd format for this post here.

I find that I don't need to write as many mathematical formulas here.  Although Quarto enables that easily as well.  Here's one of my favorites, the formula for [information entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy#Information_theory).

$$H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i) \log p(x_i)$$

I can also draw some simple diagrams using a builtin [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) syntax:


```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Hard edge] --> B(Round edge)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C --> D[Result one]
  C --> E[Result two]
```

I can also easily embed youtube clips:

All in all, most of the basic WYSIWYG functionality is handled through simple
text specification.  There's ways to tweak things using css, but for now I'm
happy with some basic defaults and theming.

There's two main reasons why I think it's worth using Quarto:

# It's Free

It doesn't cost a dime to use Quarto.  I simply took the time to set it up with my free Github account, and use it to publish my site free on Github as well.

Now, there are some that will argue that Quarto is not at all free, in fact it costs time to set this up and write things yourself.

However, I would also argue:

# It has a High "Give a S@&$! Factor"

We're entering an age where most text written online will be generated or
influenced by a generative AI.  This post has been written with the help of
one.  However, I believe that human communication requires some actual
friction... some way of showing that the author cares about the topic.  It's
going to get very difficult to do that unless you structure your communication
in a way that shows a deep level of interest in a topic, and not just churning
out dross for the sake of posting to Linkedin.

The main reason isn't that it's cheap or shows you care though, it's because
you should own your story as long as you can, and you will probably outlive any
company that tries to do too many things for you.  This brings up the next
advantage of Quarto:

# It's Open Source and Lindy

Technology has been around long enough that it should be clear that languages,
frameworks, and applications come and go along with the companies that invent
them.  The concept of [Lindy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect)
argues that future life expectancy of some non-perishable thing (like an idea
or technology) is proportional to its age.  Right now, Quarto is built on top
of some of the earliest ideas in all of computer theory, and its editable and
usable inside my
[Neovim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)#Neovim) editor, which
itself is based off of the [VI
editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi_(text_editor)) from 1976, using the
[QWERTY keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY)  from 1878.
None of these technologies are going to go anywhere.  They're good bets for
writing things down that you want to control and preserve.

# Thanks for Reading!

I hope I gave a good overview of what Quarto is about, and why it matters.
Hoping to see your Quarto site out there as well some day!
