# Description of blog post
Paper books are often seen as a dinosaur in the era of Generative AI.
However, they serve as a vital 'ground truth' for human generated
content, and AI interfaces into specific books can provide a stable
question and answer platform against a static source of ideas.

# Description of "Hidden Power of Rising Dividends"
On October 19, 1987, the world watched in disbelief as stock exchanges
across the globe began to plummet. As he witnessed millions of dollars
drain from the portfolios his small investment firm managed, Greg
Donaldson was flooded with uncertainty. Within hours, everything he
thought he knew about investing quickly faded into the darkness of
“Black Monday.”

But what he thought was the worst day of his professional life,
unexpectedly became the greatest turning point of his career. During
that fateful day, he received three phone calls that opened his eyes
to a neglected method of valuing an investment. The Hidden Power of
Rising Dividends follows Greg as he embarks on a quest guided by
wisdom and faith, to find a stock’s true value using a simple but
powerful strategy.

Donaldson’s timeless narrative is more than just a book on investing.
It’s a personal journey, with engaging real-life anecdotes and
dramatic insights that will both inform and entertain readers. The
author eloquently weaves his discovery of a safe and financially
rewarding investment strategy with the raw realities of building a
trustworthy financial firm at the height of stock market hysteria.
This story will inspire you to think about your own life in new and
provocative ways…and teach you not only how to invest wisely but how
to live life fully.
