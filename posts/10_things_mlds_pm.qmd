title: "10 Things an AI Project Manager Needs To Know"
description: "Managing an AI project isn’t like traditional software development—it’s messy, experimental, and requires constant iteration. Data is rarely clean, models need fine-tuning, and deployment is just the beginning. Success comes from setting clear metrics, planning for maintenance, and knowing when ML is the right tool (and when it’s not). Most importantly, strong communication keeps everyone aligned and avoids the dreaded “black box” syndrome."

## 1. Data is Everything (And It’s Often Messy)
![Messy Data](images/omgjjd_norman_rockwell._messy_room_and_not_much_time_to_clean_i_199bfde1-85fc-42bc-a48f-443e05f2ba0c.png)
ML models live and die by the quality of data. Unlike traditional software, where development is more deterministic, ML projects require extensive data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing before even getting to model training. PMs should allocate time and resources for proper data preparation rather than assuming clean datasets exist.


## 2. Models Are Not Magic – They Require Experimentation
![Intelligence Requires Experimentation](images/omgjjd_norman_rockwell._Models_are_not_magic._They_require_expe_8c440650-e881-4580-afcc-e7b0a748722c.png)
ML isn’t just about feeding data into an algorithm and getting perfect results. It involves iterative experimentation, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation to find the best-performing model. Rushing the process or setting unrealistic deadlines can lead to poor model performance and technical debt.


## 3. Define Success Metrics Early
![Defining Success](images/omgjjd_norman_rockwell._multi-ethnic._define_sucess_metrics_ear_00c79b48-3650-4165-8681-7cb7ee60fd54.png)
Project Managers should work with ML teams to define clear, measurable success metrics upfront. Whether it’s accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, or business KPIs, agreeing on success criteria helps avoid last-minute changes in expectations.


## 4. ML Models Need Maintenance and Monitoring
![Some Maintenance Required](images/omgjjd_norman_rockwell._multi-ethnic._robots_require_maintenanc_68f61ca3-00c0-4f6d-bd8d-648c9b35fa3b.png)
Unlike traditional software, ML models degrade over time due to data drift and changing user behavior. Deployment is just the beginning—models require ongoing monitoring, retraining, and evaluation. PMs should plan for post-deployment maintenance and allocate resources accordingly.

## 5. Computational Costs Can Be High
![Costs are High](images/omgjjd_norman_rockwell._money_problems._04914a25-c5f1-4c36-b52a-3dfe88f50fe2.png)
Training large ML models, especially deep learning models, requires significant computational resources. GPUs, TPUs, and cloud compute can be expensive. PMs should work with engineers to balance cost, performance, and feasibility when designing ML solutions.

## 6. Explainability Matters – But It’s Not Always Easy
![Explainability Matters](images/omgjjd_norman_rockwell._parents_looking_disappointed_at_kids_th_87f1f2b0-7dc2-4ab6-9f52-fdb26600b226.png)
Stakeholders often ask, "Why did the model make this decision?" While some models (like decision trees) are interpretable, deep learning models can be black boxes. Expecting full explainability from every ML model is unrealistic, but PMs should work with engineers to determine an appropriate level of transparency.

## 7. Not Every Problem Needs Machine Learning
![AI Not Required](images/omgjjd_norman_rockwell._multi-ethnic._Not_every_problem_needs_m_664350cd-c96b-4175-a167-7bd4796b353c.png)
Just because ML is trendy doesn’t mean it’s always the best solution. Many problems can be solved with simpler heuristics, rule-based systems, or traditional analytics. PMs should work with engineers to evaluate whether ML is the right tool for the job rather than assuming it’s always necessary.

## 8. Data Privacy and Compliance Are Critical
![Courtroom Drama](images/omgjjd_norman_rockwell._multi-ethnic._children._courtoom_argume_178079bc-979f-4ce9-90f9-f7826db8db42.png)
ML engineers need to follow strict data privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA. PMs should be aware of these regulations and plan projects with compliance in mind, ensuring legal and ethical handling of user data.
## 9. Data Scientists and ML Engineers Are Not the Same
![Different Breed](images/omgjjd_norman_rockwell._data_scientists_and_ML_engineers_are_no_6f4b16c4-d547-47f9-b7a6-3f481e9c79b1.png)
While both roles work with data, data scientists focus on analytics, insights, and modeling, while ML engineers focus on productionizing and scaling models. Understanding this distinction helps PMs allocate tasks more effectively and set realistic expectations.

## 10. Communication Is Key – Avoid the “Black Box” Syndrome
![Mysterious Black Box](images/omgjjd_norman_rockwell._multi-ethnic_workplace._mysterious_blac_32589cdc-96d7-4d32-b1b8-d0ffab14d73c.png)
ML engineers and data scientists sometimes get deep into technical work, making it hard for PMs and stakeholders to follow. At the same time, vague project requirements can lead to misalignment. Regular check-ins, clear documentation, and collaborative discussions ensure everyone stays on the same page.
