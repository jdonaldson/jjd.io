abstract="The emotional experience of an interactive system has been the subject of a great deal of recent interest and study in the HCI community. However, many of researchers have pointed out the extreme difficulty in predicting or controlling these emotional experiences through intentional design choices. However, the user study we conducted proposes a different point-of-view than these claims. Although these emotional responses were not always tied directly to the device itself and influenced by contextual factors, we discovered that certain controllable aspects of interactive products showed clear patterns of emotion in the responses of our participants. We discuss our findings and provide implications for the design of emotional experiences in interactive devices.",

 abstractNote={Recommender systems have been part of the Internet for almost two decades. Dozens of vendors have built recommendation technologies and taken them to market in two waves,
 roughly aligning with the web 1.0 and 2.0 revolutions. Today recommender systems are found in a multitude of online services. They have been developed using a variety of techniques and user interfaces. They have been nurtured with millions of users’ explicit and implicit preferences (most often with their permission). Frequently they provide relevant recommendations that increase the revenue or user engagement of the online services that operate them. However,
 when we evaluate the current generation of recommender systems from the point of view of the “recommendee,
” we find that most recommender systems serve the goals of the business instead of their users’ interests. Thus we believe that the big promise of recommender systems has yet to be fulfilled. We foresee a third wave of recommender systems that act directly on behalf of their users across a range of domains instead of acting as a sales assistant. We also predict that such new recommender systems will better deal with information overload,
 take advantage of contextual clues from mobile devices,
 and utilize the vast information and computation stores available through cloud-computing services to maximize users’ long-term goals},

abstract = {Recommendation systems leverage several types of information relating to a recommendable item. The recommendation methods are often based on the analysis of how a set of users associate or rate a given set of items, but they can also focus on the analysis of how the content of the items is related. This paper discusses a hybrid recommendation system for music - a system that leverages both spectral graph properties of an item-based collaborative filtering association network as well as acoustic features of the underlying music signal. Both features are balanced appropriately and used to disambiguate the music-seeking intentions of a user.},

abstract = {Although there has been a drastic increase in the research of aesthetics of interaction, we still lack well-defined practical knowledge of how to design aesthetic interactions. In order to develop such knowledge, we adapt three important ways of thinking in designing interactions influenced by traditional design disciplines, namely, 1) understanding what it is that is designed---i.e. interaction, 2) knowing what is possible to be manipulated when designing interactions---i.e. attributes of interaction, and 3) mastering how to manipulate the attributes to shape the interactions. We explain our approach by arguing from the somaesthetic perspective. We propose the concept of interaction gestalt, as a way to achieve those three ways of thinking in design. We then propose a set of interaction gestalt attributes that can be used in designing aesthetic interactions. We end with a discussion of the implications and benefits of this approach in interaction design.},
