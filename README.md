# Curriculum Vitae

LaTeX source for the resume of Ross Barnowski: [resume.pdf](/resume.pdf)

## Attribution

This document derives from an open-source [LaTeX Resume template provided by Chris
Paciorek](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~paciorek/computingTips/Latex_template_creating_CV_.html).
The template itself based on the `res.cls` document style, originally provided
by Michael DeCorte. Additional information on original contributions can be
found in the `res.cls` file, including updates provided by Venkat Krishnamurthy.

## Using the template

This resume template is intended for researchers/academics.
The main change from the original template from DeCorte/Paciorek is the 
addition of bibliography functionality so that publications, conference 
presentations, etc. can be handled using bibtex.

`make` is used to build `resume.pdf` from the source files using `pdflatex`.
